**Institution:** National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli
**Author:** Ankit Kashyap

This thesis explores the potential of **quantum computing** to outperform classical methods in solving complex computational problems.

* **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT):**
  Implemented and simulated using **Qiskit**, QFT acts as the quantum version of the classical Fourier transform. It is a fundamental block of algorithms such as **Shor’s factoring algorithm** and provides exponential speedups in certain computational tasks.

* **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE):**
  A core quantum algorithm used to estimate eigenvalues of unitary operators, forming the backbone of many advanced algorithms in **cryptography, chemistry simulations, and optimization**.

* **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):**
  Two approaches were implemented:

  1. **Classical Brute Force** – checks all permutations, accurate but computationally expensive.
  2. **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** – a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that leverages quantum principles to approximate solutions more efficiently for large-scale problems.

**Key Contributions:**

* Designed and simulated **QFT and QPE circuits** with Bloch sphere visualizations.
* Compared **classical brute force vs. quantum VQE approaches** for solving TSP.
* Showed how **quantum algorithms can achieve speedups** and open new frontiers in optimization and information processing.
